    content: `The SHA256 Hash Generator is a powerful online tool that creates SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) hashes from text or file inputs. SHA256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, typically expressed as a 64-character hexadecimal number.<br><br><strong>Key features:</strong> The tool supports both text and file inputs, offers multiple output formats including hexadecimal and Base64, provides real-time character and byte counting, and maintains a history of recent hashes for easy reference. SHA256 is considered cryptographically secure and is widely used for digital signatures, blockchain technology, and secure password storage. All processing is done locally in your browser for maximum security and privacy.`

  faq: [
    {
      q: 'What is SHA256 hashing?',
      a: 'SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, typically displayed as a 64-character hexadecimal number.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Is SHA256 secure for passwords?',
      a: 'SHA256 alone is not recommended for password storage. For secure password hashing, use dedicated algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with proper salting.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What are the output formats available?',
      a: 'The tool supports two output formats: Hexadecimal (64 characters) and Base64 encoding. Hexadecimal is the most common format for SHA256 hashes.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I hash files with this tool?',
      a: 'Yes, you can upload files to generate their SHA256 hashes. The tool supports files up to 100MB in size.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Is my data secure when using this tool?',
      a: 'Yes, all processing is done locally in your browser. Your data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.'
    },
    {
      q: 'What is the difference between MD5 and SHA256?',
      a: 'MD5 produces a 128-bit hash while SHA256 produces a 256-bit hash. SHA256 is more secure and collision-resistant, making it the recommended choice for security applications.'
    },
    {
      q: 'How accurate are the generated hashes?',
      a: 'The tool uses the industry-standard CryptoJS library to ensure accurate and reliable SHA256 hash generation that matches other standard implementations.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Where is SHA256 commonly used?',
      a: 'SHA256 is widely used in blockchain technology (Bitcoin), digital signatures, SSL/TLS certificates, file integrity verification, and many other security applications.'
